## Introduction

Python SDK is a full, backwards incompatible rewrite of the deprecated `cartodb-python` SDK. 
Since the initial rewrite, Python SDK has been loaded with a lot of new features, not present in old _cartodb-python_.

Python SDK is a Python library to consume the CARTO APIs. You can integrate Python SDK into your Python projects to:

- Import data from files, URLs or external databases to your user account or organization
- Execute SQL queries and get the results
- Run batch SQL jobs
- Create and instantiate named and anonymous maps
- Create, update, get, delete and list datasets, users, maps...
- etc.

You may find specially useful the [examples]({{site.pythonsdk_docs}}/examples/) section for actual use cases of the CARTO Python SDK.

Please, refer to the [reference]({{site.pythonsdk_docs}}/reference/) or the source code for further details about modules, methods and parameters.

**Tip:** Code snippets provided in this developer guide are not intended to be executed since they may not contain API keys or USERNAME values needed to actually execute them. Take them as a guide on how to work with the modules and classes
