## Guides

This section contains documentation on how to use the different _carto-python_ APIs.

_carto-python_ is a full, backwards incompatible rewrite of the deprecated _cartodb-python_ SDK. Since the initial rewrite, _carto-python_ has been loaded with a lot of new features, not present in old _cartodb-python_.

_carto-python_ is a Python library to consume the CARTO APIs. You can integrate _carto-python_ into your Python projects to:

* Import data from files, URLs or external databases to your user account or organization
* Execute SQL queries and get the results
* Run batch SQL jobs
* Create and instantiate named and anonymous maps
* Create, update, get, delete and list datasets, users, mapsâ€¦
etc.
