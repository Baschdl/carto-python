Developer Guide
===============

This section contains documentation on how to use the different `carto-python` APIs.

`carto-python` is a full, backwards incompatible rewrite of the deprecated `cartodb-python` SDK. Since the initial rewrite, `carto-python` has been loaded with a lot of new features, not present in old `cartodb-python`.

Please, refer to the :ref:`apidoc` or the source code for further details about modules, methods and parameters.

You may find specially useful the :ref:`examples` section for actual use cases of the CARTO Python library.

.. note:: Code snippets provided in this developer guide are not intended to be executed since they may not contain API keys or USERNAME values needed to actually execute them. Take them as a guide on how to work with the modules and classes
